              Currently {calculateAge(new Date('1995-02-21'))} years old I am a developer hailing from The Netherlands. I have been a tech enthusiast
              for as long as I can remember. While attending high school my first choice of optional subjects was Informatics and this quickly showed
              to be my calling. After I graduated from high school I had no seconds thoughts about my next step - Software Engineering at a
              university. The university of choice ended up being The Hague University of Applied Sciences. After 5 years attending this university I
              obtained my Bachelor of IT in the summer of 2019. At the time of writing I am working for CGI Inc. in The Netherlands as a Frontend
              Software Engineer.

            <Typography gutterBottom paragraph align="left" variant="body1">
              In my free time I have delved into a whole slew of small projects and some of these are used very actively! Notable mentions are my
              Discord bot "Ribbon" built with NodeJS and a whole slew of NodeJS based libraries. Some of these libraries have their groundwork in
              JavaScript, however since learning TypeScript I have converted them to this language as these days I have a strong preference for
              TypeScript and its static type checking. I have also learned C# as I have been delving into the Unity3D Game Engine for the Game Design
              minor I have followed as part of my Software Engineering major.

            <Typography gutterBottom paragraph align="left" variant="body1">
              I still have a very broad future ahead of me and I expect that CGI will help me achieve many of my dreams. That said, however, playing
              games has always been my biggest hobby and now that I have had a taste of creating games I really feel like it would be a perfect match
              for me. However, I have also grown a passion for the frontend side of software engineering which is why I feel right at home where I
              found my first job after graduation.
